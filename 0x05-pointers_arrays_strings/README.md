This Readme file contains the problems in the file that this Directory contains.

Tasks

0. Write a function that takes a pointer to an ``int`` as parameter and updates the value it points to to ``98``.

``Prototype: void reset_to_98(int *n);``. solved on(0-reset_to_98.c).

1. Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

Prototype: ``void swap_int(int *a, int *b);``. solved at(1-swap.c);

2. Write a function that returns the length of a string.

Prototype: ``int _strlen(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: ``strlen. Run ``man strlen ``to learn more. Solved at(2-strlen.c);

3. Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

Prototype: ``void _puts(char *str);``
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: ``puts``. Run ``man puts`` to learn more.

4. Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

Prototype: ``void print_rev(char *s);. Solved at(4-print_rev.c).
